# Lambda-Function-Simplified-Function-Creation
A lambda function, also known as an anonymous function, is a concise way to create small, throw-away functions in Python. It's defined using the lambda keyword and can accept any number of arguments, but it only has a single expression.

Examples:

    Double: double = lambda x: x * 2
    This lambda function doubles the input x.

    Multiply: multiply = lambda x, y: x * y
    This lambda function multiplies two numbers x and y.

    Add: add = lambda x, y, z: x + y + z
    This lambda function adds three numbers x, y, and z.

    Full Name: full_name = lambda first_name, last_name: first_name + " " + last_name
    This lambda function concatenates a first name and a last name to form a full name.

    Age Check: age_check = lambda age: True if age >= 18 else False
    This lambda function checks if a person's age is 18 or above, returning True if it is and False otherwise.
